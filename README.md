AdventureWorks Sales Analysis

üîç Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from the AdventureWorks2022 database using T-SQL. It focuses on extracting key insights about products, customers, and sales territories by creating views, analytical queries, stored procedures, and performance optimizations.

üß∞ Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server 2022
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL

üìÇ File Structure
create_view.sql -- Sales summary view
analysis_queries.sql -- Analytical queries for reporting
sales_procedure.sql -- Stored procedure with parameters
indexes_and_optimization.sql -- Index creation and performance analysis

üîß Features
- View for consolidated sales data
- Top products per territory
- Parameterized procedure for product revenue
- Indexed queries for better performance

‚úÖ How to Use

1. Restore the `AdventureWorks2022` database on your SQL Server.
2. Run `create_view.sql` to create the base view for analysis.
3. Use `analysis_queries.sql` to generate reports by product, region, and customer.
4. Execute `sales_procedure.sql` to create a reusable procedure for top product revenue.
5. Test performance in `indexes_and_optimization.sql` using `STATISTICS IO` and `TIME`.

üìå Key Concepts Practiced
- Complex joins between sales, customers, and product tables
- Reusable views for cleaner querying
- Aggregation and filtering for business reporting
- Stored procedures with input parameters
- Performance tuning using indexes and query stats

Advanced Analysis Queries (`advanced_analysis.sql`)

This file contains advanced analytical queries on the AdventureWorks2022 database to extract deeper business insights:

- **Revenue by Sales Territory:** Summarizes total sales revenue grouped by geographic territories.
- **Top 5 Best-Selling Products:** Lists the top 5 products ranked by total revenue generated.
- **Top 10 Customers by Spending:** Identifies customers with the highest total purchases.
- **Monthly Average Order Value:** Calculates average order value for each month, showing sales trends over time.

These queries complement the base analysis and demonstrate skills in aggregation, ranking, and time-based reporting.
